        Heck, last year I gave a talk about how I wanted to create a local-first
        timer website that would send you a push notification when the timer was
        done, without needing a server. Feels like something you should be able
        to just do with a Service Worker, but itâ€™s actually impossible without a
        server processing the timers in the background. The web is limited.
